This dataset comprises 3D point clouds of diverse indoor scenes collected using a terrestrial laser scanner (Faro) since 2024 on National University of Singapore campus. The scenes include structural components, mechanical and electrical (M&E) systems, and architectural heritage. The dataset will be progressively updated with new data on the project website. Data collection and processing for M&E plant rooms was carried out by Boyu Wang, Mingkai Li. Data collection for the Digital Design Lab was carried out by Kexin Li, Xiuqi Li and Vincent Gan. Data collection for the SDE3 Architecture Studio was conducted by Ryan and Vincent Gan. Data collection for the NUS Baba House was undertaken by Jingxuan Li and Vincent Gan.
